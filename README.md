# jf

A wrapper around jq to avoid typing common patterns.

This is a fork of Tomnomnom's gf. Gf is a really awesome wrapper around grep, it allows you to really quickly speed up your workflow when working with grep. I was using gf when I realised, wait, this would be dope for parsing json too with jq!

So I forked https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf, all credit to tom for the original idea and codebase. All I basically did was a find & replace on "gf" and "grep" and since they work basically the same way, syntactically, we have ourselves another little utility!
